 pony.EVTDESC2: "It seems a few lunatic monks have experienced visions and are spreading the word of a 'revelation' : our religion and way of life since the Celestian Englightenment would be wrong. These heretics assert Luna, Celestia's own sister, has revealed them our State is employing the dvine knowledge it has been given for wrong deeds. The end does not justify the means, and the world (and the pony people in particular) does not deserve such violence and imperialism. They call for a peaceful and joyful life without confrontations with our neighbors. These Selenite ideas are spreading like wildfire through the country."
